# How to access the deployed app

**IMPORTANT:** This solution includes fake credit card entry on the order screen. This solution is not compliant with any credit card processing standards and should not be used for this purpose. Please do not enter real credit card numbers when using this app.

You can try the deployed app by visiting: [http://udacity-fsjd-project-4-ls.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/](http://udacity-fsjd-project-4-ls.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

When you first visit the app you will see the products page with the available products in the store. You are free to browse and add items to your cart without registering or logging in, but you won't be able to complete an order until you do register and/or login.

By all means register a new account (there is no email verification in this version, so you can just use a fake email). Alternatively, you can login as an existing account:

```
username: testuser
password: shopper123
```

After you have logged in, if you go to the Cart screen, you can now complete your order. Please note the credit card field will happily accept any 16 digit number, so there is no need to use a real credit card.
