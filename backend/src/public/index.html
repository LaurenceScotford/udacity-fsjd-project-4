        <h2>Using the API</h2>
        <p>The API supports the following operations:</p>
        <h3>User operations</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Register user</td><td>This is for creation of non-administrative users, e.g. customers. This operation does not require authorisation, so can be used for self-service registration.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Create user</td><td>This is a generalised operation for creation of users and it requires authorisation. This operation can be used for creating admin users, for example. A user can only create other users up to and including their own level of authorisation.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Index users</td><td>This lists all users on the system. It is only accessible to admin users.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Show user</td><td>This shows a single user. Non-admin users can only access their own record.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Update user</td><td>This enables an existing user record to be updated. Non-admin users can only update their own record.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Destroy user</td><td>This enables a user record to be permanantly removed. Non-admin users can only destroy their own record. This operation will fail if there are any orders belonging to this user</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Authenticate user</td><td>This should be used as part of a login process to verify a user. This operation is required before many other operations can be carried out.</td></tr>

        <h2>Authorisation</h2>
        <p>The system works on the principle that each user has an authorisation level. The minimum authorisation level is 1 and higher levels can be any integer value above this. There are three levels of authorisation:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>End user - this level is intended to represent customers. They have access to all operations required for creating and maintaining their user account and for making and modifying orders.</li>
            <li>Admin user - this level is intended to represent administrative users. They have access to all operations and can access data not directly associated with their user account.</li>
            <li>Super user - this is a permanant user. Only one super user account exists and it is created automatically when the application begins. The presence of the super user account ensures that the full REST api can always be accessed, even if no other user accounts exist. When the application is first started after an install, you will want to authorise the super user account and use this to create any admin level user accounts that are initially required. NOTE: Creation fo additional super user accounts or modification/deletion of the existing super user account is not permitted within the API.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A few operations, e.g. viewing products or product categories, can be accessed with authorisation. Most operations require a user to be authenticated before they can be accessed. Use the Authenticate route to authenticate a user. If the user is valid, this route will return a secure web token. This token must be sent in the Authorization header with any operation that requires authorisation.</p>
        <p>For operations that require authorisation, there are potentially two levels of access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Own records: The user can only access records that are owned by them, e.g. their user account and their orders. Customers are generally confined to this level of access.</li>
            <li>Universal access: The user can access any records. This level of access is generally assigned only to administrative users.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>A note on password security</h2>
        <p>Passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the database. The API will never return password data, therefore, when a user record is requested, the password property is always blank. One possible method for handling lost passwords, given this configuration, is for an admin user to modify the user record with a temporary password and then for the user to change this after successful login.</p>
