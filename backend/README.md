| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Register user     | This is for creation of non-administrative users, e.g. customers. This operation does not require authorisation, so can be used for self-service registration.                                                                                  |
| Create user       | This is a generalised operation for creation of users and it requires authorisation. This operation can be used for creating admin users, for example. A user can only create other users up to and including their own level of authorisation. |
| Index users       | This lists all users on the system. It is only accessible to admin users.                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Authorisation

The system works on the principle that each user has an authorisation level. The minimum authorisation level is 1 and higher levels can be any integer value above this.
The default build assumes three levels of authorisation:

- Level 1: End user - this level is intended to represent customers. They have access to all operations required for creating and maintaining their user account and for making and modifying orders.
- Level 2: Admin user - this level is intended to represent administrative users. They have access to all operations and can access data not directly associated with their user account.
- Level 3: Super user - this is a permanant user. Only one super user account exists and it is created automatically when the application begins. The presence of the super user account ensures that the full REST api can always be accessed, even if no other user accounts exist. When the application is first started after an install, you will want to authorise the super user account and use this to create any admin level user accounts that are initially required. NOTE: Creation fo additional super user accounts or modification/deletion of the existing super user account is not permitted within the API.

A few operations, e.g. viewing products or product categories, can be accessed with authorisation. Most operations require a user to be authenticated before they can be accessed.
Use the Authenticate route to authenticate a user. If the user is valid, this route will return a secure web token. This token must be sent in the Authorization header with any operation that requires authorisation.

For operations that require authorisation, there are potentially two levels of access:

- Own records: The user can only access records that are owned by them, e.g. their user account and their orders. Customers are generally confined to this level of access.
- Universal access: The user can access any records. This level of access is generally assigned only to administrative users.

Any route that requires authorisation is first passed through the verifyAuthToken middleware. This middleware takes three additional parameters: minimum level for any access, minimum level for universal access, comparison property for ensuring access to own records only (this can be set to null for records where there is no concept of ownership by a user account, e.g. catgeories or products). Attempts to access this route by a user without the required authorisation level will be blocked.

#### Example

Let's say that the minimum level for any access is set to 2 and the minimum level for universal access is set to 3. This is how the following three users would be impacted:

| User    | Authorisation level | Access permitted |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Alan    | 1                   | None             |
| Barbara | 2                   | Own records only |
| Colin   | 3                   | All records      |

### A note on password security

Passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the database. The API will never return password data, therefore, when a user record is requested, the password property is always blank. One possible method for handling lost passwords, given this configuration, is for an admin user to modify the user record with a temporary password and then for the user to change this after successful login.

### Tips

- You will need to use the superuser account to create your initial admin user(s). Once you have at least one admin user, you can switch to that account for further user creation if you wish
- API operations on the superuser account are not permitted, i.e. you can't use the API to update or destroy the superuser. The superuser account will also not be revealed by any show or index operations.
- Users are not permitted to read, update or destroy user accounts at a higher authorisation level than their own
- Users created using the register option are always created at the default authorisation level
- Users at the default authorisation level (customers) are not permitted to update or destroy category and product records and can only read, update and destroy other records that belong to them

## Set up and scripts

### To set up the project

Create two `.env` files in the project root: `.env.development` and `.env.test` for the development and test environments respectively. **IMPORTANT NOTE: An example .env file has been included for the purpose of testing the solution only - do not use the credentials in this file for production databases. To use this, you can simply rename `.env.example` to `.env.development` and/or `.env.test`**

The .env files should contain the following environment variables. :

| Variable name          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ENV                    | This should normally be left set to 'dev' to ensure the development database is used (this database is persistent and will not be removed or deleted between sessions). This variable will automatically be overwritten to use the test database if the test suite is run (see Test script below). |

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You should not include the .env file in your production environment. Instead set these variables directly in your production environment.

For testing and development environments, open a terminal in the project root and **set up the database** (NOTE: this app uses a dockerised version of the postgres database for testing and development to avoid having to install and set up postgres locally. You will need to have the Docker engine installed and running first if you don't already have it. [Getting started with Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started))

```
docker-compose up
```

Open a new terminal in the project root (leaving the terminal with Docker open and running) and **install the application** NOTE: You can start the install process while the docker containers are still being created but please wait for the dockerised databases to be ready to accept connections before completing any further steps:

```
npm install
```

Not a required set up step, but at this point you might want to **run the test suite** to ensure that everything is running as it should:

```
npm run test
```

NOTE: The test suite uses the Test database - this database is set up immediately prior to running the tests and then torn down again immediately afterwards.

Not a required set up step, but if you are making changes to the source files you might want to **start the application in development mode**:

```
npm run watch
```

This will run the required database migrations and then start the application while watching for changes to the source files. If the source files are updated, the application will restart.

**Start the application** in production mode:

```
npm run start
```

NOTE this will compile the source files and run the required database migrations using db-migrate before starting the server.

**Stop the application**:

You can stop the running node server by hitting `CRTL + C` in the terminal in which it is running. Note this will terminate the application but will leave the database intact and the postgres servers running.

To **remove the database** (CAUTION: This will permanantly destroy all data):

```
npm run migrate-down
```

To **stop and remove the postgres database servers**:

```
docker-compose down
```
